This is a simple tool to migrate Flickr photo set to Picasa

Pre-requirement:
Modules - 
Beej's Python Flickr API (http://stuvel.eu/flickrapi)
Google GDATA/Picasa (http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/code.html)
Python Image Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

Others - 
FLickr API key (http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
Gmail account

Usage:
use "python flickr_listsets.py" to find out all you photosets and their IDs
use "python flickr2picasa.py photoset_ID" to move photos to Picasa

This script will download original photos from Flickr and resize to no large than 2048x2048 before uploading to Picasa (that's the new limit to Picasa free quota)
